this web page is a mix of  -----------   .ntk (nunjucks)   .md (markdown text files)


Why use this approach of Netlify + 11ty ?
I don't know why.  I suppose it's OK if you already love 11ty.
If you are using Netlify, then maybe this approach gets you started.
But there is a learning curve to 11ty.  It seems to be a tool for tech people, 
who want to hand-craft their website.
I built an ugly site here.  Maybe somebody 11ty-oriented could pretty it up.


Also, this 11ty template is big on the blog thing.  But I cant find docs on how to create 
blog info.

Wordpress approach might be better, there are zillions of html-oriented starting points.
But I don't know if you can host a wordpress site on netlify without jumping hoops.

maybe a pure html css template could be a starting point instead of all this 11ty shit.
Or, just do Angular, and leave the alternatives to other thinkers.
