# Welcome Home Sentient Beings
home file is eleventy-netlify-boilerplate/pages/home.md
this web page is a mix of  -----------   .ntk (nunjucks)   .md (markdown text files)


Why use this approach of Netlify + 11ty ?
I don't know why.  I suppose it's OK if you already love 11ty.
If you are using Netlify, then maybe this approach gets you started.
But there is a learning curve to 11ty.  It seems to be a tool for tech people, 
who want to hand-craft their website.
I built an ugly site here.  Maybe somebody 11ty-oriented could pretty it up.


Also, this 11ty template is big on the blog thing. 
But I cant find docs on how to create blog info. (create 'posts').
It seems like you create more .md files in github, and re-publish.

I mean, go to github, folder bla bla bla, create sixthPost.md file 
to do a new post?  
geez.

Wordpress approach might be better, if ya wanna blog... 
there are zillions of starting points,
that make prettier pages.
Maybe you can host a wordpress site on netlifysomehow?


maybe a pure html css template as starting point instead of all this 11ty shit?
Or, just do Angular, and leave the alternatives to other thinkers.
