# Welcome Home Sentient Beings
home file is eleventy-netlify-boilerplate/pages/home.md
this web page is a mix of .ntk (nunjucks)  and  .md (markdown text files)
Look mom, i'm writing text as markdown in eleventy-netlify-boilerplate/pages/home.md
See the BLOG section for notes on markdown.

##### Why use this approach of Netlify + 11ty ?
I suppose it's OK if you already love 11ty,
along with the static page and snippet-driven-design.
OK, some call this Component Driven Design.  Sheesh.
If you are using Netlify, then maybe this approach gets you started.
But there is a learning curve to 11ty.  
It seems to be a tool for tech people, 
who want to hand-craft their website.
I built an ugly site here.  Maybe somebody 11ty-oriented could pretty it up.
I'm trying to use bulma.css and markdown .md ,  and the various .ntk files.

##### how to create blog info. (create 'posts').
It seems like you create more .md files in github, and re-publish.
I mean, go to github, folder bla bla bla, create sixthPost.md file 
to do a new post.  More info on the blog pages.
 

##### why 11ty  Blog here?
Mainstream blog apps like wordpress might be a better fit for most.
those apps make pretty pages by choosing a template 'off the rack'.
This app, GenXYZ, is for tech people learning 11ty and netlify.
 
 ##### Forms, Blog, boiler plate?
 If ya don't wanna capture forms data (like forget the contact page)
and ya don't wanna bother with a blog  (like kill the blog and posts stuff)
and instead, a wanna create a portfolio-ish 'static' site...
then maybe start with this boiler plate page,  change the nav stuff,
and create a .njk file (and maybe a .md file)  for each nav option.
The .md file has a line for which layout (njk file) it should use.
So, for a portfolio, maybe stick nice html into each .njk file.

July 2020 I've been working on the .njk templates, 
along with the .md files.
This 11ty example project has a complex folder structure. 
well, i commented out inline.css and replaced it with bulma.css

##### Hey, get with the program
.ntk files are html templates (no content)
.md files are content
ok, .md examples have html shorthand too.
