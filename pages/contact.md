hello from contact.md
file: eleventy-netlify-boilerplate/pages/contact.md
The layout for the  form on this page is file: eleventy-netlify-boilerplate/_includes/layouts/contact.njk
The contact form on this page is file: eleventy-netlify-boilerplate/_includes/components/form.njk
The contact form on this page uses
[Netlify Forms](https://www.netlify.com/docs/form-handling/) to process
submissions, and saves them in the connected Netlify account where
notifications can optionally be configured. Each submission is passed through a
spam filter and if flagged, will display a CAPTCHA challenge to the user.
... well, that all sounds nice, but it seems like the Netlify owner has to go into netlify and
find the submitted forms.  So, ya gotta get into netlify to see if anybody has contacted you.
