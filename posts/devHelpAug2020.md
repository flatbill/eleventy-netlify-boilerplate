##### Favicon.   lotsa work to put a crummy icon on the browser tab.
 
draw an icon on this page:
https://brunoportfolio.com/online_tools/iconpaint/index.php
then download it, and rename it to favicon.ico  (try the download folder).
move favicon.ico to the source code folder. (try github repo or local angular folder).

You still might see an old favicon.ico after ya generate the app again, then build > deploy > publish, and refresh.
Go local, and delete a chrome folder.  oh but first ya gotta shut down chrome.
