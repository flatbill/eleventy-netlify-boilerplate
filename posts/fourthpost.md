The natural world is the only world we know. And we know a lot, compared to people 10,000 years ago.

OK, so what should I type in this markdown file?  My words and wisdom, of course, but should I be concerned about format?
I am hitting enter as I type, to put in line breaks.
Like this.
And this.

Ready for some blank lines?  here are three of them:



Or, if I just type on and on, and on and on,  and on and on, and on and on, and on and on, and on and on, and on and on, and on and on, and on and on, and on and on, and on and on, and on and on, and on and on, and on and on, and on and on, and on and on, and on and on, and on and on, and on and on, and on and on, and on and on, and on and on, and on and on, and on and on, and on and on, and on and on, and on and on, and on and on, and on and on, and on and on, and on and on, and on and on, and on and on, and on and on, and on and on, then what?

This page has some examples of how confusing the content vs layout can be.
I am typing inside a file called fourthpost.md
Notice markdown or 11ty transforms text with a .md  to a nonsense link.
Notice markdown does not transform text like this --> blewMyNoseTooHard.txt

So, now as I type, I have to be aware of Markdown rules.
Like, where page breaks come in.
and whether I can stick a greater than sign on the front of text, like this:
> hello I am text with a greater than sign in front.

and, usually, Markdown does h1 stuff when you stick a pound sign on the front of text, like this:
# hello I am a header.  
but because I use bulma.css, maybe the h1 stuff gets over-written?


here is markdown with a sample image:

So, now I know how to stick images in this markdown, instead of images in the html.
When do images belong in html ? (or in an njk file in this case) 
What images belong in the .md file?   (maybe blog-ish images?)
When is the blogger a different person than the web page programmer?
What does a blogger have to know about that damn web page programming?

As a blogger, I guess I have to follow rules when creating .md files:
a) stick some front loader stuff in the top of the .md file 
a) the web page programming uses bulma, so dont type pound sign and other characters in the line starting character.
b) inserting image 'reference' is OK, but this reference means a link to somewhere, so the image is NOT stored with the .md file.
